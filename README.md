## Coromandel

Coromandel Peninsula is located in the upper North Island of New Zealand.

#### points.laz (©Regional Software Holdings Limited (RSHL) – CC BY 4.0)

This point cloud represents data elevation measured by LiDAR technology, distribute by the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment[^1]. 
The data was captured between 21 January 2024 and 17 May 2024. 

## Everest 

This site covers the Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, in the Himalayan mountain range.

#### LE71400412000304SGS00_B4.tif and LE71400412000304SGS00_RGB.tif (©U.S. Geological Survey)

Two Landsat satellite raster images B4 (red) and RGB of the area, were acquired on the 30/10/2000 at 30 m spatial resolution.

#### 15_rgi60_glacier_outlines.gpkg (CC BY 4.0)

This vector file, from the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI 6.0)[^2], presents the vector outlines for glaciers and glacier 
complexes around the area (dates vary but are usually centered around 2000).

## Exploradores

Exploradores Glacier is a glacier located on the northeastern slope of Monte San Valentín, in the Chilean Patagonia.

#### AST_L1A_00303182012144228_Z.tif 

The Aster satellite raster elevation data of the area, were acquired on the 18/03/2012 at 30 m spatial resolution. 
It was generated with MicMac[^3] adapted for ASTER[^4] using ASTER L1A V003 data (VNIR bands) from NASA/JAXA[^5].

#### 17_rgi60_glacier_outlines.gpkg (CC BY 4.0)

This vector file, from the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI 6.0)[^2], presents the vector outlines for glaciers and glacier 
complexes around the area (dates vary but are usually centered around 2000).
